Test IPv4 multicast packets.

Use two programs to send and receive multicast packets.  After
setting up the socket, the receiver forks and execs the sender to
avoid races.  If the test fails, the receiver runs into a timeout.

The test programs are:
mcsend  - send one multicat UDP packet
mcrecv  - receive one multicast UDP packet

The options for mcsend and mcrecv are:
-f file         print message to log file, default stdout
-g group        multicast group, default 224.0.0.123
-i ifaddr       multicast interface address
-l loop         disable or enable loopback, 0 or 1
-m message      message in payload, maximum 255 characters, default foo
-n timeout      expect not to receive any message until timeout
-p port         destination port number, default 12345
-r timeout      receive timeout in seconds
-t ttl          set multicast ttl
mcsend ...      after setting up receive, fork and exec send command
