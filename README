Test IPv4 multicast packets.

mcsend  - send multicat UDP packet
mcrecv  - receive multicast UDP packet

Use two programs to send and receive multicast packets.  After
setting up the socket, the receiver forks and execs the sender to
avoid races.  If the test fails, the receiver runs into a timeout.
